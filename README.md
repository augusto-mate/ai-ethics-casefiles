*A portfolio exploring real-world challenges in AI ethics through practical demonstrations and actionable recommendations.*

## 📌 Project Overview

AI systems increasingly shape decisions in hiring, healthcare, and public policy. This project investigates two ethically controversial cases — one in recruitment, the other in healthcare — and features an interactive demonstration of algorithmic bias.

## 📂 What’s Inside

- `src/bias-demo.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook demonstrating gender bias in algorithmic decisions  
- `slides/ai-ethics-casefiles.md` — Presentation for stakeholders and non-technical audiences   
- `docs/report.md` — Written analysis of case studies, with citations and ethical insights  
- `assets/` — Stores the cover image used as a banner in the documentation
- `docs/export/` — PDF versions of notebook, slides, and report
