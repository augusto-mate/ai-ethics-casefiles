# Ethics Casefiles

![Cover](docs/assets/cover.png)

## 🧠 About the Project

**AI Ethics Casefiles** is a critical analysis of two real-world AI systems, exploring their ethical implications and proposing actionable improvements.  
Originally created as part of an AI ethics program, this enhanced version turns that academic submission into a professional portfolio asset with code, visuals, and web-ready content.

## 🔎 What's Inside

| Component       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| 📄 [Report](docs/report.md) | Detailed Markdown version of the case study |
| 🧪 [Bias Demo](src/bias-demo.ipynb) | A simple notebook demonstrating algorithmic bias |
| 🎞️ [Slides](slides/ai-ethics-casefiles-slides.pdf) | Presentation for stakeholders and non-technical audiences |
| 🌐 [Web Version](site/) *(optional)* | Interactive online version of the report (e.g. MkDocs) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Augusto047/ai-ethics-casefiles.git
cd ai-ethics-casefiles
```

To view the notebook:

```bash
cd src
jupyter notebook bias-demo.ipynb
```

## 🚧 Ethical Assumptions & Limitations

This project uses small-scale, illustrative datasets that may not reflect real-world complexity. The bias detection shown is meant to demonstrate general principles, not to serve as a production-ready audit. Assumptions include that datasets carry historical bias and that fairness can be evaluated using basic metrics.

For real-world deployments, more rigorous validation and stakeholder consultation are required.
